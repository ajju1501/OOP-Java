# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Welcome to the **OOP in Java** repository! This repository contains various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice codes implemented in Java. The examples showcase different OOP principles such as **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**, along with real-world projects.

## Repository Structure

```
OOP-in-Java/
â”‚â”€â”€ src/                # Java source codes for different OOP concepts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ examples/       # Real-world examples (Event Management, Gym Membership, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ testcases/      # Test cases for the implemented programs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core_concepts/  # Basic OOP practice files
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Features
- **Encapsulation:** Demonstrates data hiding using getters and setters.
- **Inheritance:** Showcases parent-child relationships between classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Implements method overloading and overriding.
- **Abstraction:** Uses abstract classes and interfaces for better design.
- **Real-World Examples:**
  - **Event Management System**
  - **Gym Membership System**
  - **Bank Account Management**
  - **Library Management System**
  - **Student Management System**
